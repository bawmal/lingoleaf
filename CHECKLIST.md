## üêõ Troubleshooting

**If something breaks:**

2. Check Twilio console for SMS errors
3. Check Supabase logs
4. Verify all environment variables are set
5. Test locally with `netlify dev`

**Common Issues:**
- **SMS not sending:** Check Twilio credentials, verify phone number is SMS-capable
- **Form not submitting:** Check Netlify Functions logs, verify DB connection
- **Wrong timezone:** Update plant's `timezone` field in database
- **Weather not showing:** Verify OpenWeatherMap API key, check lat/lon values

- [ ] Number of signups
- [ ] SMS delivery rate
- [ ] User reply rate (DONE/DRY/DAMP)
